% calcthreshpts.m
% 
% Function to determine the points that "pass" the threshold criterion in
% an image.  
% Usual application: particle tracking.  Typically first filter the image (e.g. w/ 
% bpass.m) before inputting to this function.  This function
% thresholds (various options) and looks for local maxima around which to 
% localize particles by analyzing the original (non-filtered) image.
%
% Three thresholding options, that determine the "thresh" variable.
%
% Inputs:
%    A : 2D image.
%    threshopt: determined by fo4_rp.m
%      (1) keeps all pixels with intensity above the thresh*100 percentile
%      (2) keeps pixels with intensity > thresh*std.dev. above
%          the median intensity
%      (3) keeps brightest "thresh" number of particles by finding the 
%          "thresh" brightest regions and allowing only one maximum in
%          each.
%          Note that the number of particles can be less than thresh, if
%          fewer than thresh local maxima exist.
%    thresh : intensity threshold
%          For option 2, sign should be positive (flipped by fo4_rp.m) --
%          the function makes sure of this.
%    nsize : necessary only for threshopt==3. object size used for dilating,
%        determining neighborhood size.  Roughly, the particle diameter.
%        Referred to as nsize in > June 27, 2012 fo4_rp.m,
%        since filtering object size is separated from neighborhood object
%        size; formerly called objsize.
%    try1pernhood : (optional; default false).  If true, dilate local maxima to
%        try to have only one local max per neighborhood.  Dilate by radius 
%        nsize/4 and take centroid of dilated max region.  
%        (This is always done for threshold option 3, regardless of
%        this input variable.)
%    dimg : (optional) dilated image A (pre-calculated for speed)
%          
% Outputs
%    [y, x] : positions of local post-threshold maxima 
%             (N x 1 arrays, where N is the number of maxima.  Note x and y
%             are whole numbers).
